 <p>About me</p>
<p>Originally from southern China, came to Florida State for master degree, I was get used to warm weather and still struggling with the coldest weather in Virginia (but I love the snow!). For my personality, if you interested in [MBTI personality test](https://www.16personalities.com/), I was identified as [ISFJ](https://www.16personalities.com/isfj-personality) (However I believe the result sometimes changes). Surprise all my family members are categorized in that personality as well.</p>
 <p>Hobbies</p>
 <p>Outside the research and class, I like walking, reading fanfic and playing video games. I am enjoying single player exploring and farming videos games such as Zelda and Stardew Valley</p>

 <p>Volunteer Activities</p>
 <p>I don't have too my females friends neither during working experience nor research experience, I believe encourage more female students to computer science is essential. Therefore, I volunteered to serve as Judge in HackViolet event, one of coding completion host by The Association of Women in Computing to encourage women developers learning coding. If you need any computer science mentorship or you know there is any computer science event for women, feel free contact me!</p>
