<p style="text-align: center; font-size:25pt;"> Research Interest</p>
<p>My main research interest is software engineering, particularly in software Graphic User Interface (GUI) testing. GUI testing is a specific testing techinque that simulate user behavior to testing visual element, such as clicking (user behavior) a button (visual element) to verify button functionality.

  Based on my personal work experience, I realized while GUI testing plays an important role in verifying software functionality from user behaviors perspective, it still does not get enough attention from both industry and academy. Therefore, my long-term goal is identifying and analyzing the challenges of usage of GUI testing techniques, come up with useful ideas and implement them to reduce the barrier of GUI testing creation and usage for test engineers, ultimately improve the product quality and developers' productivity.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size:25pt;">Current Research Project</p>
<p>One of the ongoing projects is exploring the challenges and practices of adopting GUI testing frameworks into CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery) practices from developersâ€™ perspective. Continuous Integration and Delivery are modern development processes to automate all the processes before deploying the environment after a code change. However, this process will usually be halting by unsuccessful testing, such as GUI testing. Therefore, identifying the challenges and practices of developers faced when adding GUI testing in the automation process can help to provide useful guidelines for future developers and researchers. Since this project is still under survey phase, there is no DOI and pdf links I can provide.</p>
