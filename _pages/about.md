My name is Xiaoxiao Gan, I am a second year PhD student in Virginia Tech. I am interested in software engineering, particularly in automated testing, code quality improvement, software maintenance and evolution. My goal is to strengthen my skills for research in the field of software engineering to improve productivity by developing automated tools that support developers’ work.

I was born in southern China and completed my basic education
there. Before I came to Virginia Tech, I gained my fundamental knowledge in Computer Science in Guangxi University for my
bachelor degree of network engineering. Besides, I got my master’s degree in Computer Science from Florida State University to strengthen my skills.

After graduation for master degree, I was working as a full stack software engineer in a law enforcement software
development company. My main responsibility are designing and developing software application for
the Law Enforcement/Public Safety industry such as developing web application to process criminal data across states. I had opportunity to utilize modern front-end technologies such as React
and Angular to update the legacy project to improve the performance and user experience of the
application website. I also was exposed to business process management and software development
methodologies, such as scrum and agile process. Besides, I also worked on legacy projects that uses
CSS framework and JQuery frameworks for front-end. These working experience helps me not only
familiar with modern technologies for web application development, but also had better understanding on the history of the technologies changes and how fast nowadays technologies evolves.
