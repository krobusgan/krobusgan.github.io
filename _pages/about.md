I am a first year PhD student in Virginia Tech. I am interested in software engineering, particularly in automated testing, code quality improvement, software maintenance and evolution. My goal is to strengthen my skills for research in the field of software engineering to improve productivity by developing automated tools that support developersâ€™ work.

Before joining Virginia Tech, I received my Master from the Department of Computer Science at Florida State University. I also work as software engineer in Diverse Computing.
