My name is Xiaoxiao Gan, I am a second year PhD student in computer science program at Virginia Tech in [Code World No Blanket] (https://code-world-no-blanket.github.io/) group under [Dr. Chris Brown](https://chbrown13.github.io/).

I am interested in software engineering, particularly in automated GUI (Graphic User Interface) testing, code quality improvement, software maintenance and evolution. My goal is to strengthen my skills for research in the field of software engineering to improve productivity by developing automated tools that support developers’ work.

I was born in southern China and completed my basic education there. Before I came to Virginia Tech, I gained my fundamental knowledge in Computer Science in Guangxi University for my bachelor’s degree of network engineering in 2016. Besides, I got my master’s degree in computer science from Florida State University to strengthen my skills.
After graduation for my master’s degree in 2018, I was working as a full-stack software engineer in a law enforcement software development company from 2019-2022. The working experience inspired my research interest in Graphic User Interface testing.

Besides work and research, I'm enjoying walking and causal Nintendo gaming (probably take it too serious sometimes). I am also passionate about supporting women in the Science society such as encourage more female student joining the Computer Science area. One of my contributions is I volunteered to serve as HackViolet judge in past two years.
